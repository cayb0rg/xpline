A one-dimensional LED Strip XP Farm, inspired by the [Line Wobbler](https://www.wobblylabs.com/line-wobbler) dungeon crawler.

Implemented motion and light detection using sensors to trigger spider spawning. 

I designed the joystick using two MPU6050 accelerometers. Upon a future revisit, I plan to use a spring doorstop and printed 3D base for the joystick handle.

The ESP8266 module has wireless communication, allowing players to access and monitor their XP farm remotely via an HTTP server.
